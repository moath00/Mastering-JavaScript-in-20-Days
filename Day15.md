# Day 15: Closure - Modules - Objects (Oriented):

### Closure:

Closure is when a function “remembers” its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that lexical scope. Closure: NOT capturing a value, it take the reference and work with it's value even if it's modified and change. Loops are examples of closures (setTimeout(inLoop)).

### Modules:

Modules encapsulate data and behavior (methods) together. The state (data) of a module is held by its methods via closure. In ES6, modules pattern used is import/export syntax sugar.

### Objects (Oriented):

- this
- class { }
- Prototypes
- Object Linking to Other Object (OLOO) design pattern (or “Inheritance”) vs. Object Oriented (OO) design pattern (or “Behavior Delegation”).

This : A function's this references the execution context for that call, determined entirely by how the function was called. A this-aware function can thus have a different context each time it's called, which makes it more flexible & reusable.

> Dynamic Context != JS's Dynamic Scope.
